### Scheduling A Shift
{: .no_toc }

When scheduling a shift, make sure you have scheduled it on the trelo board, so the shift shows up on the session board. This is **required** when scheduling a shift. Make sure you set th due date to when the shift starts, and add the **scheduled** tag. When it starts, add the **in progress**, and when it ends, add the **completed** tag. When it is cancelled, add the **cancelled** tag, and when it is postponed, add the **postponed** tag and change the due date.
